Desing and implement a class dayType that implements the day of the week in a
program. The class dayType should store the day, such as Sun for Sunday. The program
should be able to perform the following operations on an object of the type dayType:

a. Set the day.
b. Print the day.
c. Return the day.
d. Return the next day.
e. Return the previous day.
f. Calculate and return the day by adding certain days to the current day. For example,
   if the current day is Mondey and we add 4 days, the day to be returned is Friday.
   Similarly, if today is Tuesday and we add 13 days, the day to be returned is Monday.
g. Add the appropriate constructors.
