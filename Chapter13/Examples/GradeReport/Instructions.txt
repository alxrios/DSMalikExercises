composition.
Thie mid-semester point at your local university is approaching. The registar's office
wants to prepare the grade reports as soon as the student's grades are recorded. However,
some of the students enrolled have not yet paid their tuition.
	1. If a student has paid the tuition, the grades are shown on the grade report
	   toguether with the grade-point average (GPA).
	2. If a student has not paid the tuition, the grades are not printed. For these students,
	   the grade report contains a message indicating that the grades have been held for
	   nonpayment of the tuition. The grade report also shows the billing amount.
The registar's office and the business, office want your help in writing a program that
can analyze the student's data and print the appropriate grade reports. The data is stored
in a file in the following form:

15000 345
studentName studentID isTuitionPaid numberOfCourses
courseName courseNumber creditHours grade
courseName courseNumber creditHours grade
.
.
.
studentName studentID isTuitionPaid numberOfCourses
courseName courseNumber creditHours grade
courseName courseNumber creditHours grade
.
.
.
The first line indicates the number of students enrolled and the tuition rate per credit
hour. The student's data is given thereafter.

A sample input file is as follows:

3 345
Lisa Miller 890238 Y 4
Mathematics MTH345 4 A
Physics PHY357 3 B
ComputerSci CSC478 3 B
History HIS356 3 A
.
.
.
The first line indicates that the input file contains 3 student's data and the tuition rate
is $345 per credit hour. Next, the course data for student Lisa Miller is given: Lisa
Miller's ID is 890238, she has paid the tuition, and is taking 4 courses. The course num-
ber for the mathematics class she is taking is MTH345, the course has 4 credit hours, her
mid-semester grade is A, and so on.

The desired output for each student is in the following form:

Student Name: Lisa Miller
Sutdent ID: 890238
Number of courses enrolled: 4

Course No Course Name Credits Grade
CSC478    ComputerSci      3      B
HIS356    History          3      A
MTH345    Mathematics      4      A
PHY357    Physics          3      B

Total number of credits: 13
Mid-Semester GPA: 3.54

It is clear from this output that the courses must be ordered according to the course
number. To calculate the GPA, we assume that the grade A is equivalent to 4 points, B is
equivalent to 3 points, C is equivalent to 2 points. D is equivalent to 1 point, and F is
equivalent to 0 points.

Input A file containing the data in the form given previously. For easy reference, let us
assume that the name of the input file is stData.txt

Output A file containing the output in the form given previously.
