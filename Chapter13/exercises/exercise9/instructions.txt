Using the classes extDateType (Programming Exercise 8) and dayType
(Chapter 10, Programming Exercise 5), design the class calendarType so
that, given the month and the year, we can print the calendar for that month.
To print a monthly calendar, you must know the first day of the month and the
number of days in that month. Thus, you must store the first day of the month,
which is of the form dayType, and the month and the year of the calendar.
Clearly, the month and the year can be stored in an object of the form
extDateType by setting the day component of the date to 1 and the month
and year as specified by the user. Thus, the class calendarType has two
member variables: an object of the type dayType and an object of the type
extDateType.
Design the class calendarType so that the program can print a calendar for
any month starting January 1, 1500. Note that the day for January 1 of the year
1500 is a Monday. To calculate the first day of a month, you can add the
appropriate days to Monday of January 1, 1500.
For the class calendarType, include the following operations:
a. Determine the first day of the month for which the calendar will be printed.
Call this operation firstDayOfMonth.
b. Set the month.
c. Set the year.
d. Return the month.
e. Return the year.
f. Print the calendar for the particular month.
g. Add the appropriate constructors to initialize the member variables.
