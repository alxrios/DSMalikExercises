The class dateType defined in Programming Exercise 6 prints the date in
numerical form. Some applications might require the date to be printed in
another form, such as March 24, 2017. Derive the class extDateType so
that the date can be printed in either form.
Add a member variable to the class extDateType so that the month can
also be stored in string form. Add a member function to output the month
in the string format, followed by the yearâ€”for example, in the form March
2017.
Write the definitions of the functions to implement the operations for the
class extDateType.
