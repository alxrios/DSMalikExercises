Amanda and Tyler opened a business that specializes in shipping liquids, such
as milk, juice, and water, in cylinderical containers. The shipping charges
depend on the amount of the liquid in the container. (For simplicity, you
may assume that the container is filled to the top.) They also provide the
option to paint the outside of the container for a reasonable amount. Write a
program that does the following:
a. Prompts the user to input the dimensions (in feet) of the container
(radius of the base and the height).
b. Prompts the user to input the shipping cost per liter.
c. Prompts the user to input the paint cost per square foot. (Assume that
the entire container including the top and bottom needs to be painted.)
d. Separately outputs the shipping cost and the cost of painting.
Your program must use the class cylinderType (designed in
Programming Exercise 3) to store the radius of the base and the height
of the container. (Note that 1 cubic feet ¼ 28.32 liters or 1 liter ¼
0.353146667 cubic feet.)
